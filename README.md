# ðŸ§  Anxiety in Context

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project explores patterns in self-reported anxiety levels using a [synthetic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/natezhang123/social-anxiety-dataset). It implements a **stacked modeling approach** to distinguish between **low-to-moderate (1â€“7)** and **high anxiety (8â€“10)**, combining logistic and linear regression models.

The analysis prioritizes interpretability, model diagnostics, and actionable insights. The full write-up is available as a Quarto website:

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   Investigated variable distributions, missingness, and correlations. Identified strong signals in stress and sleep quality. And motivated a stacked modeling approach to separate low-to-moderate from high anxiety.

2. **Modeling Low/Moderate vs High Anxiety**  
   Used logistic regression to flag individuals at high risk (8â€“10). Demonstrated strong performance and interpretability.

3. **Modeling Low/Moderate Anxiety (1â€“7)**  
   Compared linear and ordinal logistic regression. Linear model was favored for clarity and robustness.

4. **Modeling High Anxiety Separately**  
   Analyzed the distinct response patterns in high anxiety cases, justifying separate treatment due to skew and tail behavior.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results

- **Stress** and **sleep** are the strongest predictors of anxiety.
- **Therapy attendance** is associated with high anxiety â€” likely a result of reverse causality.
- **Linear regression** handles ordinal responses reasonably well and offers strong interpretability.
- **Logistic regression** effectively identifies high-anxiety individuals with minimal false positives.
